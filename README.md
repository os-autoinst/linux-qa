# linux-qa

Welcome to the Linux QA collaboration repo.

We are interested in end-to-end testing of open source operating systems
for PCs and smartphones.

## Monthly call

The next call is: Thursday 6th February @ 16:00 UTC.

The agenda is [here](https://pad.gnome.org/Cva60O0bQz2Rls2ArIvJhw#), please add
topics that you want to discuss.

## Date and time

The call will happen monthly, usually on the first Thursday of the month. To
accommodate a global community the time varies as follows:

  * Odd months -- European winter time (Jan, Mar, Nov): 9:00 UTC - 09:30 UTC

  * Even months -- US summer time (Apr, Jun, Aug, Oct): 15:00 UTC - 15:30 UTC
  * Even months -- US winter time (Feb, Dec): 16:00 UTC - 16:30 UTC

  * [PM Call](https://calendar.opensuse.org/teams/qe-tools/events/linux-qa-monthly-pm)

## Goals

The aim is to bring together:

  * downstream QA teams who are testing GNOME, KDE and other desktops
  * upstream developers who are interested in better testing
  * tooling developers who work with openQA and other testing tools.

Examples of things we can talk about:

  * Specific improvements in openQA we want to see (see wishlist)
  * How to share resources between teams and companies
  * Coordination of upstream and downstream QA efforts
  * Events and meetups
  * Best practices, tooling and documentation around QA
